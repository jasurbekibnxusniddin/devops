| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cluster**       | A set of machines (nodes) that run containerized applications managed by Kubernetes.                                   |
| **Node**          | A single machine (virtual or physical) that runs workloads. It can be a **Master (Control Plane)** or **Worker Node**. |
| **Pod**           | The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes ‚Äî usually runs one or more tightly coupled containers.                      |
| **Container**     | A lightweight, standalone executable package that includes everything needed to run an application.                    |
| **Namespace**     | A virtual cluster inside a Kubernetes cluster used to isolate resources (e.g., dev, staging, prod).                    |
| **Control Plane** | The brain of the cluster ‚Äî manages scheduling, scaling, and the cluster state.                                         |
| **Kubelet**       | Agent running on each node ensuring that containers are running as expected.                                           |

## What Exactly Is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (a.k.a. ‚ÄúK8s‚Äù) is an open-source system for **automating the deployment**, **scaling**, and **management** of **containerized applications**.

### Let‚Äôs break that into plain words üëá
| Concept                        | Meaning                                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Automating deployment**      | It runs your containers (apps) for you ‚Äî no manual starting/stopping.             |
| **Scaling**                    | It can add or remove containers automatically when load changes.                  |
| **Management**                 | It keeps your apps healthy (auto-restarts if they crash, balances traffic, etc.). |
| **Containerized applications** | Apps that run inside containers (like Docker containers).                         |

So, Kubernetes is like a ‚Äúcontainer orchestrator‚Äù ‚Äî a manager that controls a group of containers across multiple machines.
